I have tried laser cutting my enclosure, but it is not upto scale, with my design.

### November 21, 2019
The laser cut design for my enclosure is in .cdr files

I realised I was using a wrong port in my pcb. I was supposed to use pin 35, instead I used pin 37. So I created a new PCB design with correct ports.
My Firmware code runs through the 3 different shots I purposed. Straight, backhand and fronthand using the firmware code update below.

My Raspberry pi 4 got short circuited today by my own mistake, I have a lifetime warranty for it. So it will be replaced. Meanwhile I am borrowing my friend's raspberry pi 3 to test my breadboarded circuit and it works.
 
 The [code](https://github.com/Warris-Sohi/SmartTennisBallMachine/blob/master/Firmware/tbfng6621.py) with 3 different modes.
 1. Both motors runnning at same speed 
 2. Motor B running at almost half the original speed
 3. Motor A running at almost half the original speed
